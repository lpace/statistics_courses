  Output: Dr. Larry here again. In this lesson you will learn more about working with both numeric and character vectors. There are actually six different kinds of vectors in R. They are integer, real, character, logical, complex, and raw. These are called "atomic" vectors in R, but don't worry, they're not explosive!

- Class: text
  Output: As you learned in your previous lesson, to R a single number or character is also a vector. R uses a recycling property to go through the elements of a vector, and when you work with vectors of different lengths, this can make many statistical computations easier.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Let's use a shortcut feature of R to get a sequence of integers from 1 to 10. At the command prompt, type x <- 1:10 and press Enter."
  CorrectAnswer: x <- 1:10
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'x <- 1:10')
  Hint: Type x <- 1:10 and press Enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: As we did in our previous lesson, check the structure of x by typing str(x) and pressing Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: str(x)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'str(x)')
  Hint: Type str(x) and press Enter.
