  Output: In this introductory lesson, we will discuss some of the basics of R. I highly recommend that you use RStudio for these lessons, although they will work fine with the regular version of R as well.

  Output: In R, everything is an "object" of some sort. We also work with "functions" in R. This makes R simultaneously object-oriented and functional. In this lesson, you will get a better feeling for functions and objects and how they work. R is a programming language and statistical computing environment rolled into one. The most basic use of R is as an interactive calculator. The R command prompt is >. It is R's way of telling you it is ready for your input.

  Output: To R, even a single number or character is a "vector." Other languages allow you to define a constant or scalar value, but R does not. To see what I mean, at the command prompt, type 2 + 2 and press Enter.
  CorrectAnswer: 2 + 2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = '2 + 2')
  Hint: Type 2 + 2 and press Enter.

  Output: Note the [1] in front of the answer to your addition problem. It is an index telling you that to R, 4 is a vector of length 1. R makes use of "vectorization" in many ways that help with statistical computations, and help you avoid explicit looping in many cases.
